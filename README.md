<h1 align="center">ðŸ‘‹ Hi! Call me Desky!</h1>
Welcome to my GitHub Profile!<br>
You probably found this profile while you were randomly checking out other profiles on Discord, right? After all, I'm not that active here to appear in the main page or something.<br>
I'm not a fenomenal full-stack developer, neither some CSS expert. In fact, I do programming for fun! Which explains why there aren't many repositories around here. Perhaps, there's only the README repository.<br>
But I do open some repositories once in a while, when I start a project all of a sudden, because who knows? Maybe some developer of another world come here and give me a fresh clean code. So if you see something hanging here, feel free to commit! <br>

# ðŸ“¦ What are my usual projects?
When I start a repository here, its more related to Discord bots in JavaScript. But I'm trying to get some free time in my life so I can explore more of the programming world.

# ðŸŒŽ How to reach me?
Since I'm not that active in GitHub, sending me a message through here would be like a gambling, for the exception that instead of money, you are trying to get some kind of answer. But, I'm active in the following platforms:
- You can send a message in my Discord, **Desky#2725**.
- I'm also active on [**Twitter!**](https://twitter.com/braziliandesky)
- You can also try my [**Instagram.**](https://instagram.com/brazilian.desky)
